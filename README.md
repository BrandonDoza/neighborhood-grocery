## Context:
### This project was given as a take home challenge to show my abilities in creating a mock grocery store application in React from scratch.
- I was given one week (no hour limit was given) to complete this challenge.
- I spent approximately 11 hours from start to finish, including design and deployment.
- I was required to use the Edamam food database api for this project. https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs
- It was required to have a user be able to search for food items from the database, be able to add and remove items to a cart, view that cart, and checkout/purchase the items in the cart.
- I was given complete control on the design and structure of the application.
## Goals:
- Build a react application with multiple pages that allows users to manipulate data in some way (search, filter, add, and remove)
### Wins:
- Completing the project in the timeframe alloted while balancing working with a friends GC company to get some income coming in for my family.
- Implementing React and Router, and designing the application from the ground up.
- Using a public API
